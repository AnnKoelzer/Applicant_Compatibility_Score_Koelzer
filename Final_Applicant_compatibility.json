##Importing team data from JSON file into MYSQL: consisting of three people and four attributes
SELECT * FROM tuk33468.team_table;

##Altered team table to add 5 columns. These columns will be for the weighted attributes as well as the score
ALTER TABLE tuk33468.team_table
ADD COLUMN intelligence_weight FLOAT Default 0,
ADD COLUMN creativity_weight float default 0,
ADD column communication_weight float default 0,
Add column experience_weight float default 0,
Add column scores float default 0;

##To encorporate the above columns into team_table, I created team_table_two. I assigned a weight for each attribute according to their importance.
Create table team_table_two AS
SELECT name,
	intelligence * 0.2 AS intelligence_weight,
	creativity * 0.3 AS creativity_weight,
	communication * 0.35 AS communication_weight,
	experience * 0.15 AS experience_weight,
	intelligence,
    creativity,
    experience,
    communication
FROM team_table;

Select * from team_table_two;

##Joining original table (team_table) with new weighted scores table (team_table_two)
SELECT tuk33468.team_table.*, team_table_two.*
FROM tuk33468.team_table
JOIN team_table_two
ON team_table.name = team_table_two.name;

##I created another table with only weighted attributes as well as a column which calculates the weighted average for each person
Create table t3 AS
SELECT name,
	intelligence_weight,
    communication_weight,
    experience_weight,
    creativity_weight,
	(team_table_two.intelligence_weight + team_table_two.creativity_weight + team_table_two.communication_weight + team_table_two.experience_weight) / 1 As score
FROM team_table_two;

SELECT * from t3;

## This is the applicant table, I copied the above steps and inserted columns for weighted attributes and their scores
ALTER TABLE tuk33468.applicant
ADD COLUMN intelligence_weight FLOAT Default 0,
ADD COLUMN creativity_weight float default 0,
ADD column communication_weight float default 0,
Add column experience_weight float default 0,
Add column score float default 0;

## Here, I am creating a new table that will encompass the weighted attributes, original attributes, and score column
Create table applicant_table_two AS
SELECT name,
	intelligence * 0.2 AS intelligence_weight,
	creativity * 0.3 AS creativity_weight,
	communication * 0.35 AS communication_weight,
	experience * 0.15 AS experience_weight,
	intelligence,
    creativity,
    experience,
    communication
FROM tuk33468.applicant;

SELECT * from applicant_table_two;

###Creating new table (xapp) to put the weighted attributes and weighted average per person.
Create table a3 AS
SELECT distinct name,
	intelligence_weight,
    communication_weight,
    experience_weight,
    creativity_weight,
	(applicant_table_two.intelligence_weight + applicant_table_two.creativity_weight + applicant_table_two.communication_weight + applicant_table_two.experience_weight) / 1 As score
FROM applicant_table_two;

SELECT * FROM a3;

##Comparing compatibility of each applicant to each team member
SELECT 
    a3.name AS applicant_name,
    t3.name AS team_member_name,
    1 - (ABS(a3.score - t3.score) / ((5 * a3.intelligence_weight) + (5 * a3.creativity_weight) + (5 * a3.communication_weight) + (5 * a3.experience_weight))) AS compatibility
FROM a3
CROSS JOIN t3
ORDER BY applicant_name, team_member_name;

##Final compatibility score of each applicant based on averaging the compatibility score between applicant and each team member
SELECT 
    c.name AS applicant_name,
    AVG((c.score * t.score) / 100) AS compatibility_score
FROM combined_table c
JOIN t3 t ON c.teamname = t.name
GROUP BY c.name;
